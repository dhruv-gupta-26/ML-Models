# My Machine Learning Models Repository 

## Overview

Welcome to my personal repository for Machine Learning models! This space is dedicated to showcasing various machine learning algorithms and techniques I've learned and implemented. Each project within this repository will feature a practical application of an ML model, accompanied by data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

This repository serves as a practical portfolio of my journey in machine learning, demonstrating my ability to apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems.

## Current Projects

### 1. Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes Classifier

* **Problem Type:** Binary Classification (Positive / Negative Sentiment)
* **Domain:** Customer Reviews

#### Project Description

This project implements a sentiment analysis model to classify customer reviews for a hypothetical company (ABC) as either **positive** or **negative**. It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques from NLTK for text preprocessing and utilizes a **Naive Bayes classifier** from `scikit-learn` for classification.

#### Key Aspects & Technologies Used:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handled raw text data by performing **tokenization, lowercasing, punctuation removal, stop word elimination**, and **lemmatization** (using NLTK) to prepare it for machine learning.
* **Feature Engineering:** Transformed textual data into numerical features using **Bag-of-Words (BoW)**.
* **Model:** Employed a **Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier**, chosen for its effectiveness and efficiency in text classification tasks, particularly with count-based features.
* **Evaluation:** Assessed model performance using standard classification metrics such as **Accuracy and Confusion Matrix**.


#### Limitations & Future Enhancements for Sentiment Analysis:

* **"Naive" Assumption:** The core assumption of feature independence in Naive Bayes can be a limitation for complex language nuances.
* **Contextual Understanding:** This basic implementation may struggle with sarcasm, irony, or complex negation, as it doesn't deeply understand semantic context or word order beyond simple word presence/frequency.
* **Potential Improvements:**
    * Implementing **N-grams** (e.g., bigrams, trigrams) to capture basic word sequences.
    * Exploring more advanced models like **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** or **Deep Learning models** (RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers) for richer contextual understanding.
    * Utilizing **word embeddings** (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) to represent words semantically.

## Future Models (Coming Soon!) 

I plan to expand this repository with more machine learning projects, which may include:

* Implementing Linear Regression from scratch (without built-in model).
* Implementing a basic Neural Network from scratch using NumPy.
